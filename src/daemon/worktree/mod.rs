//! Git worktree isolation: each task can optionally run in its own worktree so
//! parallel tasks don't conflict on the same working tree.
//!
//! A worktree is created under `<project>/.orchestrai/worktrees/<task_id>` on a
//! branch `warpforge/task/<task_id>` (derived from the current HEAD). When the
//! task completes the worktree can be merged back and removed, or left for
//! manual inspection. Older tasks may still have checkouts under the legacy
//! `<project>/.worktrees/<task_id>`; those paths are used exactly as recorded.
//!
//! A task can instead start from a chosen base branch, from origin, or on an
//! existing branch or pull request ([`StartPoint`]).
//!
//! Split by topic: [`manager`] holds the manager's git operations, [`detached`]
//! the manager-free versions that run off the actor, [`discover`] the boot
//! rebuild from persisted tasks, [`resolve`] and [`pull`] the base choice, and
//! [`start`] the checkouts it produces. [`setup`] applies the project's
//! `worktree:` config to a new one; [`inventory`], [`size`] and [`reclaim`]
//! serve the Worktrees panel.
