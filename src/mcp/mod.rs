//! MCP (Model Context Protocol) stdio server exposing orchestration tools to an
//! orchestrator agent.
//!
//! The orchestrator agent spawns this binary as an MCP server subprocess (wired
//! via the ACP `mcpServers` config). It speaks MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio to
//! the agent and connects *back* to the running warpforge daemon over the
//! daemon's WebSocket API (endpoint + token from `~/.warpforge/daemon.json`),
//! translating tool calls into daemon commands.
//!
//! Tools:
//! - `spawn_agent(agent, task)` — dispatch a sub-agent asynchronously; returns
//!   immediately. The result lands in the orchestrator's inbox on completion.
//! - `read_inbox()` — drain finished sub-agent results.
//! - `message_agent(task_id, message)` — send a follow-up message to a running
//!   or idle sub-agent, continuing the same session.
//! - `list_agents(project?)` — list this orchestrator's child sessions.
//! - `stop_agent(task_id)` — hard-stop one owned child session while retaining
//!   history. Also stops an owned workflow pipeline.
//! - `cleanup_agents(max_age_seconds?, dry_run?, include_active?)` — permanently
//!   remove selected child sessions and their task history.
//! - `spawn_workflow(workflow_id, goal, agent)` — dispatch a deterministic
//!   multi-stage pipeline (plan/implement/review/fix) as a child of this
//!   orchestrator, same lifecycle as `spawn_agent`.
//! - `pause_workflow(task_id)` / `resume_workflow(task_id, note?)` — soft-pause
//!   an owned pipeline at its next stage boundary, or resume it.
//! - `answer_workflow(task_id, message)` — answer a pipeline stage's pending
//!   question (`need_user_input`).
//! - `decide_workflow(task_id, decision, rounds?, note?)` — decide what an
//!   owned pipeline does once it has exhausted its review rounds.
//!
//! Environment (set by the daemon when it starts the session; legacy daemons
//! set the `WF_ORCH_*` spellings instead):
//! - `WF_TASK`    — the session's task id (the inbox owner / parent).
//! - `WF_PROJECT` — the project this session is scoped to. Unset falls back to
//!   the registered project containing the working directory, so the bridge can
//!   also be configured once globally and run outside the daemon.
//! - `WF_MODE`    — `orchestrator` to expose the spawn/inbox/workflow tools on
//!   top of the runtime ones. Anything else (or unset) means a single session.
//! - `WARPFORGE_SESSION_TASK` / `_PROJECT` / `_MODE` — the same three, set on the
//!   agent process rather than the server entry; they take precedence
//!   (`identity.rs`).
