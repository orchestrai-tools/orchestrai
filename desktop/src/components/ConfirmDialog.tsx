 * Ask before doing something that cannot be taken back.
 *
 * `window.confirm` is not an option in this app: the webview answers it without
 * ever drawing it, so the action went through with nobody asked. This is the
 * shape the app already confirms destructive work in (`RemoveProjectDialog`,
 * `FileSystemActionDialog`), kept in one place so every caller asks the same
 * way — and so no caller reaches for the native one again.
 *
 * The dialog owns the in-flight state: it stays open and reports the failure if
 * `onConfirm` rejects, because a destructive step that failed must not look
 * like one that worked. The caller closes it when the work is done.
